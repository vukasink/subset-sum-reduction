# Solving Subset Sum Problem Using Lattice Reduction

Welcome. This repository contains subset sum problem instances used for experiments
in my Master's thesis, results and various python scripts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generated instances and corresponding lattice bases can be found in instances/ folder.

Various results of the experiments can be found in results/ folder. In there, subfolder ssred\_category\_I\ contains the results of solving random subset sum problems and subfolder ssred\_category\_II\ contains the results of solving modular subset sum problems.

Modified G6K files that were used instead of the ones provided by default in G6K library can be found in g6k-tmp/ folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file ssred\_hybrid.py contains the implementation of attack idea presented in Chapter 5. This file will probably be updated in the future.

thesis.pdf file is my Master's thesis in the state it was given in for grading on 17.10.2019.
